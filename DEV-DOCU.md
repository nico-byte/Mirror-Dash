## Introduction

This is a multiplayer browser game built with Phaser 3 and Socket.io. It features a unique split-screen setup where each player sees their own character in the top screen and the other player in a mirrored world in the bottom screen. Players can create lobbies, join each other's games, and play together in real-time.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

-   `client/`: Frontend application built with Phaser and Vite

    -   `src/game/`: Core game code
        -   `main.js`: Game configuration and startup
        -   `entities/`: Game entities like Player class
        -   `scenes/`: Phaser scenes (Boot, Preloader, Menu, Lobby, Game)
    -   `public/assets`: Game assets

-   `server/`: Backend Node.js server using Socket.io
    -   `server.js`: Socket.io server for handling multiplayer functionality
    -   `package.json`: Server dependencies

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js and npm installed
-   Git for version control

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    cd [repository-name]
    ```

2. Install dependencies for both client and server:

    ```bash
    # Install client dependencies
    cd client
    npm install

    # Install server dependencies
    cd ../server
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the client directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

### Running the Development Environment

To run both the client and server concurrently:

```bash
# From the root directory
make dev
```

Or run them separately:

```bash
# Run the client
cd client
npm run dev

# Run the server
cd server
npm run nodemon
```

The client will be available at http://localhost:8080 and the server at http://localhost:9000.

## Game Concept

The game implements a unique split-screen multiplayer mechanic:

1. **Split-Screen Layout**:

    - The screen is split horizontally into two halves
    - Top half: Player's own view
    - Bottom half: Mirrored view showing the other player

2. **Mirrored Worlds**:

    - Both players see the same level layout
    - In the bottom view, everything is vertically mirrored
    - This creates a unique gameplay mechanic where you need to coordinate with the other player who is seeing a mirrored view

3. **Platformer Gameplay**:
    - Simple platformer mechanics: movement and jumping
    - Jump pads to reach higher platforms
    - Multiple platforms at different heights to navigate

## Key Components

### Client-Side Components

#### Game Scene (`Game.js`)

-   Main gameplay scene with split-screen implementation
-   Handles player input, physics, and multiplayer state synchronization
-   Creates and manages the level with platforms and jump pads
-   Sets up dual cameras for split-screen functionality

#### Player Class (`Player.js`)

-   Represents a player in the game
-   Manages player state, movement, and visuals
-   Creates separate sprites for top and bottom screen views
-   Handles mirroring of player visuals

#### Lobby System (`Lobby.js`)

-   Allows players to create and join game lobbies
-   Shows available lobbies and connected players
-   Host can start the game when enough players have joined

### Server-Side Components

#### Socket.io Server (`server.js`)

-   Manages real-time communication between clients
-   Handles lobby creation and management
-   Synchronizes player positions and actions
-   Manages game state across connected clients

## Split-Screen Implementation

The split-screen functionality is implemented without using the `setFlipY()` method (which may not be available in all Phaser versions).

### How It Works:

1. **Dual Camera Setup**:

    ```javascript
    // Set up the main camera for the top half
    this.cameras.main.setViewport(0, 0, this.scale.width, this.scale.height / 2);
    this.topCamera = this.cameras.main;

    // Create a second camera for the bottom half
    this.bottomCamera = this.cameras.add(0, midPoint, this.scale.width, midPoint);
    ```

2. **Manual Mirroring**:

    - Objects in the bottom view are positioned using the formula:

    ```javascript
    // Mirror Y position calculation
    mirrorY = screenHeight - originalY + midPoint;
    ```

3. **Camera-Specific Visibility**:

    - Each object has two versions: one for the top camera and one for the bottom
    - Each camera ignores objects meant for the other camera:

    ```javascript
    // Make top camera ignore bottom objects
    this.topCamera.ignore([bottomObject]);

    // Make bottom camera ignore top objects
    this.bottomCamera.ignore([topObject]);
    ```

### Level Creation:

The level design is duplicated with mirroring:

```javascript
// Create a platform
const platform = this.platforms.create(x, y, ...);

// Create its mirrored version for the bottom camera
const mirrorPlatform = this.add.rectangle(
    platform.x,
    screenHeight - platform.y + midPoint,
    platform.displayWidth,
    platform.displayHeight,
    platform.fillColor
);
```

## Multiplayer Testing

To test the multiplayer functionality, you'll need to connect two clients to the server.

### Option 1: Two Browser Windows (Easiest)

1. Open two browser windows pointing to your dev server (http://localhost:8080)
2. In the first window:
    - Create a lobby and note the Lobby ID (visible in debug mode or console)
3. In the second window:
    - Join the lobby using the ID from the first window
4. Start the game from the first window (host)

### Option 2: Using Environment Variables

You can use environment variables to directly connect to a specific lobby:

1. In the first window, run the game normally and create a lobby
2. Get the lobby ID from the console or debug display
3. In the second window, set the following environment variables:
    ```
    VITE_SKIP_MENU=true
    VITE_DIRECT_CONNECT=your-lobby-id-here
    ```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode to see player positions and lobby information:

```
VITE_DEBUG_MODE=true
```

## Adding New Features

### Adding New Level Elements

To add new platforms or obstacles:

1. Modify the `createLevel()` method in `Game.js`:

    ```javascript
    // Add a new platform
    const newPlatform = this.platforms
        .create(x, y, null)
        .setScale(width, height)
        .setSize(30, 30)
        .setDisplaySize(width * 30, height * 30)
        .setTint(color)
        .refreshBody();

    // Add its mirrored version
    const mirrorPlatform = this.add.rectangle(
        newPlatform.x,
        screenHeight - newPlatform.y + midPoint,
        newPlatform.displayWidth,
        newPlatform.displayHeight,
        newPlatform.fillColor
    );

    // Set camera visibility
    if (this.topCamera) this.topCamera.ignore(mirrorPlatform);
    if (this.bottomCamera) this.bottomCamera.ignore(newPlatform);
    ```

### Adding Power-ups

To add power-ups:

1. Create a new physics group for power-ups in `createLevel()`
2. Add collision detection in the `create()` method
3. Implement power-up effects in a new method
4. Synchronize power-up collection via Socket.io

Example:

```javascript
// Create power-up group
this.powerups = this.physics.add.group();

// Add a power-up
const powerup = this.powerups.create(x, y, 'powerup-sprite');

// Add collision detection
this.physics.add.overlap(this.player.sprite, this.powerups, this.collectPowerup, null, this);

// Collect powerup method
collectPowerup(playerSprite, powerup) {
    powerup.disableBody(true, true);

    // Apply effect
    // ...

    // Notify server
    this.socket.emit('powerupCollected', {
        lobbyId: this.lobbyId,
        powerupId: powerup.id
    });
}
```

## Deployment

The game can be deployed to a cloud server using Docker containers. This section describes the deployment process using Docker Hub to store the container images.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your local machine
- A Docker Hub account
- A cloud server
- SSH access to your server

### Deployment Architecture

The deployment uses two Docker containers:

1. **Client Container**: 
   - Nginx container that serves the static Phaser game files
   - Handles routing and WebSocket proxying to the server container
   - Built from the `client/Dockerfile`

2. **Server Container**:
   - Node.js container running the Socket.io server
   - Manages game lobbies and player communication
   - Built from the `server/Dockerfile`

### Deployment Files

Key files for deployment:

- `docker-build-push-client.sh`: Builds and pushes the client Docker image to Docker Hub
- `docker-build-push-server.sh`: Builds and pushes the server Docker image to Docker Hub
- `docker-build-push.sh`: Builds and pushes both client and server Docker images to Docker Hub
- `deploy-to-cloud.sh`: Deploys the images to your cloud server
- `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the Docker containers and their network
- `client/nginx.conf`: Nginx configuration for the client container
- `client/.env.production`: Production environment variables for the client

### Deployment Steps

#### 1. Build and Push Docker Images

To build the Docker images and push them to Docker Hub:

```bash
./docker-build-push.sh <your-dockerhub-username> [tag]
```

This script:
- Logs you into Docker Hub (if needed)
- Builds the client and server Docker images
- Tags them with your Docker Hub username
- Pushes them to Docker Hub

Alternativley the client and server image can be built seperately:

```bash
./docker-build-push-client.sh <your-dockerhub-username> [tag]
```

```bash
./docker-build-push-server.sh <your-dockerhub-username> [tag]
```

#### 2. Deploy to Server

After pushing the images to Docker Hub, deploy them to your server:

```bash
./deploy.sh <server-ip> <your-dockerhub-username> [tag]
```

This script:
- Creates a production environment file with the server IP
- Kills all running containers.
- Pulls the latest Docker images on the server
- Creates a Docker Compose configuration with the correct environment variables
- Starts the containers using Docker Compose

The deployment script handles all the necessary steps.

#### 3. Accessing Your Deployed Game

After deployment, you can access your game at:

- Game URL: `http://<your-server-ip>`

The WebSocket connections are proxied through Nginx to your server, so all communication happens seamlessly.

### Environment Variables

The deployment scripts use and set the following environment variables:

- `VITE_SERVER_URL`: The URL of the Socket.io server (set automatically)
- Other game settings defined in `client/.env.production`

### Troubleshooting Deployment

To troubleshoot any deployment issues on your cloud server, ssh on to it and navigate to the mirror-dash folder:

```bash
ssh root@<your-server-ip>
cd /opt/mirror-dash
```

1. **Check Docker container logs**:
   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f
   ```

2. **Verify Nginx configuration**:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it $(docker ps -qf "name=mirror-dash-client") nginx -t
   ```

3. **Check if containers are running**:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

4. **Restart the containers**:
   ```bash
   docker compose restart
   ```

5. **Manual container management**:
   ```bash
   # Start containers
   docker compose up -d
   
   # Stop and remove containers
   docker stop mirror-dash-client mirror-dash-server
   docker rm mirror-dash-client mirror-dash-server

   # Update containers
   docker compose pull
   docker compose up -d --force-recreate
   ```

## Common Issues and Fixes

### Camera Issues

-   If cameras aren't working correctly, check if you're using the correct Phaser version
-   The `setFlipY()` method might not be available in some versions
-   Use the manual mirroring approach described in this document

### Multiplayer Synchronization

-   If player positions aren't syncing correctly, make sure you're updating positions in `update()`
-   Check socket connections in the browser console
-   Verify the lobby ID is correctly passed between scenes

### Physics Issues

-   If collisions aren't working, make sure you're adding physics bodies correctly
-   Verify that collision groups are set up properly
-   Check if object scales and sizes are appropriate for collision detection

### Button Interaction Errors

-   If UI buttons cause errors, reconstruct them completely when updating
-   Avoid modifying properties of potentially undefined objects
-   Check if `input` property exists before setting `enabled`
